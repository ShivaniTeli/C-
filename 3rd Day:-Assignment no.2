/* Design a class batsman where it can be used for maintaining the information about the player. The details can be
Name, innings played, not outs, runs. Using these details you should be able to calculate the batting
average(runs/(innings -not out)), apart from this you should design the class in such a way so that the user should be
able to add the data by themselves for number of batmanâ€™s that they will mention during the runtime and along with
that the data should be displayed on console on demand
