/* Write a program to create a customer's bill for a company. The company sells only five different products: TV, VCR, Remote controller, CD player and the tape recorder. The unit price is $400, $220, $35.20, $300 and $150 respectively. The program must read the quantity of each piece of equipment purchased from the keyboard. It then calculates the cost of each item, the sub total and the total cost after an 8.25% sales tax.
