/* Design a class student with the where you the details about the academics is required to be maintained and you may
use following tentative(you may improve on same) specifications as mentioned:
Private members of class student
Variables: Admission number, Student name, Subject marks(English, maths, science), total marks
Functions: calculatetotal() where the total subject marks as well as percentage can be calculated.
Public member function of class student
Takedata(): for user inputs
Showdata():to display all the data on the screen.
The number of students will be entered by the user itself and you may maintain an array of object for same.*/
